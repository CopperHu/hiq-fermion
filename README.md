This is HiQfermion project, a module which is compatiable with openfermion and implements more
quantum chemistry functions.
Quantum chemistry is a promising application of quantum computation in the near term device.

In the [main page](./docs/build/html/modules.html) of api-doc, you can see the api supported in our simulator.
